# The Book Search Reading Claculator Features

    Users can search a book of their choice by either typing in the title or the 10/13 digit ISBN number into the search bar.
        After a book title or ISBN number is entered, the book search will generate and return the title and author of the book, the number of pages in the book, an available cover image, as well as a link to library ratings and extra information on the book. This first part of the app will provide prelimanary information that will contribute to their final choice of book, and whether or not they want to go through with reading a book.
    
    After a specific book is searched, users can then enter their personal reading speed, as well as their reading proficiency, utilizing a drop down with various options for both decisions including slower or faster reading speeds, and not confident versus very confident reading proficiency levels.

    Based on the users' decisions of reading speed and proficiency, the app will then calculate an esitmate of how long a book should take to read by multiplying the number of pages in the book, with variable multiples that reflect the users chosen options.

    If a user does not have a specific book in mind, they also have the option to select the "Generate Random" option for a random book, that they can then go ahead and select their reading speed and reading confidence based on this random book to calculate the estimated time to read.

    In addition to looking at one book at a time, users also have the option to add books to their "favorite" list which then visually stores the books under the Favorites section on the right hand side of the site. This then makes it very easy for users to click on different favorites, and quickly calculate their respective calculated reading times in order to help make a decision of which book they would like to read!
